# Flappy Bird Game
## About the Game
Here we are going to see how to make a flappy bird game in Pygame.
Flappy Bird is a mobile game developed by Vietnamese video game artist and programmer Dong Nguyen, under his game development company. The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them.
In this game, the main objective of the player is to gain the maximum points by defending the bird from hurdles. Here, we will build our own Flappy Bird game using Python.

We will be using Pygame(a Python library) to create this Flappy Bird game. Pygame is an open-source library that is designed for making video games. It helps us to create fully functional games and multimedia programs in python.

## Step-wise Procedure:
### Building Flappy Bird Game in Python
1. Importing Modules
2. Global Variables Declared
3. Creating the “main” function
4. Creating “welcomeScreen” function
5. Creating the “mainGame()” function
6. isCollide() and getRandomPipe() functions
7. Final Output obtained

## Libraries Used:
- numpy==1.15.2
- imutils==0.5.1
- PyAutoGUI==0.9.38
- opencv_python==3.4.3.18
- pygame==1.9.4
