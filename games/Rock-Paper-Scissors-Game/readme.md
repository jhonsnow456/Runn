# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
## About the Game
A Rock-Paper-Scissors Pygame with a CNN Multiclass Classifier model built in Keras to recognize real-time hand gestures using OpenCV.
This game simply uses your computer's camera to capture realtime gestures of your hand.

The pictures taken by the camera are processed and fed to a CNN Multi-class image classifier that determines whether the gesture corresponds to "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors" gesture.


## Step-wise Procedure:
 1. Create a CNN Multi-Class Classifier
 2. Integrate it with OpenCV
 3. Create the Pygame
 4. Structure the Code
 5. Train the model

 ## Libraries Used:
- openCV 
- Python 
- numpy >= 1.13.0
- scikit-Learn >= 0.18.2
- scikit-Image >= 0.13.0
- pygame >= 1.9.3
