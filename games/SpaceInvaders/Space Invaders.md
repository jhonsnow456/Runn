# Space Invaders Game
## About the Game
Space Invaders is a simple grid-based game in which you as the shooter have to shoot down as many alien invaders before they get to you. We are going to build a 15 x 15 grid square with 20 invaders to shoot.
A web-based, browser version of the classic Arcade game: Space Invaders. Use the arrow keys to move and the space bar to shoot Every once in a while, a UFO will spawn. If you manage to shoot it down, you may receive a power up item! These power up items can upgrade your weapons or boost speed. Be sure to pick these up quickly because they will disappear!

## Features:
In our clone we have 24 invaders. These aliens heavily shell the ground. When the player shoots a missile, he can shoot another one only when it hits an alien or the top of the Board. The player shoots with the Space key. Aliens launch randomly their bombs. Each alien shoots a bomb only after the previous one hits the bottom.
