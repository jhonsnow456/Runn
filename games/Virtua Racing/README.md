## Virtua Racing
Virtua Racing, or V.R. for short, is a Formula One racing video game developed by Sega AM2 and released for arcades in 1992. Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept application for exercising a new 3D graphics platform under development, the "Model 1". The results were so encouraging that Virtua Racing was fully developed into a standalone arcade title.

### Objective of Game
The aim is to reach various checkpoints throughout each lap, but the time carries over on the next lap.
In other words, if you have a particularly lousy lap, the time will eat into your overall performance. 
With that in mind, it's a lot of fun. Virtua Racing only gets serious if you try to get the best times.

### Working of Game
The original arcade game has three levels, designated into difficulties. Beginner is "Big Forest", intermediate is "Bay Bridge" and expert is "Acropolis". 
Each level has its own special feature, for example the amusement park in "Big Forest", or the "Bay Bridge" itself, or the tight hairpin of "Acropolis". 
When selecting a car, the player can choose different transmission types.
