## Hydro Thunder
Hydro Thunder is an inshore powerboat racing video game, originally an arcade game and later released for the Sega Dreamcast as a launch title in 1999.

### Objective of Game
acing around the tracks, avoiding obstacles, other racers, flying off of water falls and ramps, boosting around sharp curves and corners while exploring for the nearest shortcut or hidden package makes for a good time on the water.

### Working of Game
Scattered across the tracks are blue and red boost icons. When touched these icons allow the player who touched them to boost. Red boost icons are more scarce than blue boost icons due to the fact red boost icons give more boost fuel. When a player has boost fuel they may use the boost button to boost, which allows a player's boat to reach speeds much higher than what would normally be possible.
The boats are divided into four categories:easy,medium,hard and bonus
