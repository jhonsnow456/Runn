# Snake game using Gesture Control
## Idea of the Game
This program can be used to play a Snake Game by detecting hand gestures to control movement of the snake on the screen. It can be implemented in Python using OpenCV library. Although, it can be used to play any game or control any application using hand gestures only. With the help of this system, it will first detect object with the help of camera accordingly specific color. Initially, we use OpenCV library, then with the help of HSV Color this system has sense to Detect their movement with 95% accuracy. After that you need to run Snake Game and Play the game. You can Turn Left , Right , Up Down Very Smoothly . Along with Snake Game, it can be used to play any game or control any application using hand gestures only.
