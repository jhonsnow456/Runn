## Missile Command
Missile Command is a 1980 shoot 'em up arcade video game.  Released during the Cold War, the player uses a trackball to defend six cities from intercontinental ballistic missiles by launching anti-ballistic missiles from three bases.

### Objective of Game
Missile Command is about taking control of several missile silos and, using their limited supply of warheads, blowing up the incoming wave of enemy missiles that are raining on the field, all with the goal of keeping your cities safe.

### Working of Game
Protect your cities from attack by moving a crosshair into the incoming missiles' path to destroy the enemy's weapons.
Click your cursor – or tap on your mobile screen - on the spot you want the bomb to explode. 
Place below the missile’s path to net the best success.
