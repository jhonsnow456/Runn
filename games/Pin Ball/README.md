## PinBall
Pinball is a coin-operated arcade game where players score points by shooting metal balls on an inclined playfield, hitting special targets, and avoiding losing their balls: throughout the 1970s 80s, high school and college students found coin-gobbling pinball machines in arcades and bars.

### Objective of Game
What is the objective of pinball?
The main objective of the game is to score as many points as the player can. Other objectives are to play as long as possible (by earning extra balls and keeping the ball in play as long as possible) 

### Working of Game
To play pinball, start by pulling the plunger at the front of the machine to release the ball. Then, use the flippers to hit the ball by pressing the buttons on the left and right sides of the machine. Try to aim the ball toward the bumpers throughout the machine, which will bounce the ball and earn you points.
