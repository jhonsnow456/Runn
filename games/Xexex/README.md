## Xexex
Xexex, released as Orius in North America, is a 1991 side-scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game by Konami. 
It draws on Irem's R-Type and Konami's other shoot 'em up Gradius, while adding the tentacle mechanics of Irem's other shoot 'em up XMultiply.

### Objective of Game
+ Lots of memorable stages and bosses
+ Includes 3 versions and a couple extra modes
- Taking damage doesn't result in enough feedback or recovery time
- Severe slowdown messes with controls
- Some segments are downright aggravating

### Working of Game
The player's ship, the Flintlock, has a detachable orb attachment called the Flint, which behaves similar to R-Type's Force Device. 
Power-ups can be obtained in the Japanese version to increase the Flint's power, movement speed, change the main weapon, or even give the player an extra life.
