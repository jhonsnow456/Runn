## Asteroids Gesture Control 
## About the Game
In this, you control a spaceship and shoot asteroids. If your spaceship collides with an asteroid, you lose. If you shoot down all asteroids, you win!
Your Asteroids game in Python will feature a single spaceship. The spaceship can rotate left and right as well as accelerate forward. When itâ€™s not accelerating, it will continue moving with the velocity it had. The spaceship can also shoot bullets.


## Game Controls:
The game will use the following key mappings:
Key	Action
- Right -	Rotate the spaceship right
- Left -	Rotate the spaceship left
- Up -	Accelerate the spaceship forward
- Space	- Shoot
- Esc -	Exit the game

## Step-wise Procedure:
1. Setting up Pygame for a Python project
2. Handing input in the game
3. Loading images and showing them on the screen
4. Creating game objects with an image, a position, and some logic
5. Moving the spaceship
6. Moving the asteroids and detecting collisions with the spaceship
7. Shooting bullets and destroying asteroids
8. Splitting asteroids into smaller ones
9. Playing sounds
10. Handling the end of the game
