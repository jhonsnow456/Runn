# Dots and Boxes
## About the Game
Dots and Boxes is a fun and simple classic pen-and-paper game for 2 or more players. The game starts with an empty grid of dots. The grid can be any size and Gametable's Dots and Boxes has a handful to choose from.

Usually a coin is flipped or Rock-Paper-Scissors is played to see who goes first, but in Gametable's Tabletop Dots and Boxes, Player 1 always starts first.

Players take turns connecting 2 unjoined horizontally or vertically adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box earns one point and must take another turn.

The game ends when all lines are drawn and boxes are claimed. The player with the most points wins. If more than one player has the same high score, the game is a tie.


## How to Play:
- Choose how many players will be in the game and whether they're human or computer players
- Each turn, drag between two horizontally or vertically adjacent dots to draw a line
- Drawing the 4th wall of a box wins it, earning you a point. When you close a box you must move again.
- Lines are drawn until all squares are claimed. The player with the most claimed squares wins!
- Be careful not to create long chains of boxes for your opponents to claim
- Think of creative ways to double cross your opponent, forcing them to give you the long chains!

## Strategy:
Most novice players always claim a box if they can, but expert players take time to consider double crossing their opponent. A double cross is when you give a short chain of boxes to your opponent and then leave them with no choice but to create a long chain for you on the next turn. It is the key to winning!
