## Arkanoid
 Controlling a paddle-like craft known as the Vaus, the player is tasked with clearing a formation of colorful blocks by deflecting a ball towards it without letting the ball leave the bottom edge of the playfield. 
 Some blocks contain power-ups that have various effects, such as increasing the length of the Vaus, creating several additional balls, or turning the Vaus into a laser cannon. 
 Other blocks may be indestructible or require multiple hits to break.

### Objective of Game
The goal of Arkanoid it to destroy a formation of rectangular blocks by bouncing a ball towards them. 
If you destroy all of the blocks, you win; if you fail to deflect the ball with your paddle – called the Vaus – and it falls out of the screen, you lose a life.

### Working of Game
In this game you must control a ball with your paddle and attempt to break all of the colored panels on each level. 
Fire your initial ball using the left click mouse button, and use your mouse to control the movement of your paddle - be sure to move quickly and anticipate the path of the ball.

As you destroy the colored panels, different power-ups will drop from the top of the level such as multi balls, a lazer cannon and a larger panel. 
Work your way through the different levels and try to complete each one with a high score.
