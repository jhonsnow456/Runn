## Tron
Tron is a coin-operated arcade video game manufactured and distributed by Bally Midway in 1982. 
The game consists of four subgames inspired by the events of the Walt Disney Productions motion picture Tron released earlier in the summer. 

### Objective of Game
The objective is to force the enemy light cycles into walls and jet trails, while simultaneously avoiding them. 
This game is based on the Light Cycle Arena sequence in the film, though the colors of the friendly and enemy characters are reversed. 
This is the only sub-game in Tron to not use the rotary dial.

### Working of Game
Tron consists of four sub-games based on events and characters in the movie. 
In general, the player controls Tron, either in human form or piloting a vehicle, using an eight-way joystick for movement, a trigger button on the stick to fire (or slow down the player's light cycle), and a rotary dial for aiming. 
The goal of the game is to score points and advance through the game's twelve levels by completing each of the sub-games.

At the start of each level, the player is taken to a "Game Grid" selection screen with four quadrants. 
The player must choose between four quadrants, each one corresponding to one of the sub-games. 
The sub-game in each quadrant is not known to the player until it is selected. 
If the player fails the game and loses a life, he/she is taken back to this selection screen and an icon representing that game is now visible.
